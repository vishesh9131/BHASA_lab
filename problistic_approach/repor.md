# Key Bayesian Concepts Implemented

1. Parameter Distributions: Each weight in the model is represented as a distribution rather than a point estimate.

2. Prior Distributions: Normal priors are defined for all parameters with configurable scale.

3. Posterior Approximation: Variational inference is used to approximate the post
erior distribution.

4. KL Divergence Regularization: Kullback-Leibler divergence between posterior and prior distributions acts as a regularizer.

5. Monte Carlo Sampling: Multiple forward passes with different parameter samples enable uncertainty estimation.

6. Uncertainty Quantification: Model outputs include both predictions and their associated uncertainties.

7. KL Annealing: Gradual increase of the KL weight during training improves training stability.
